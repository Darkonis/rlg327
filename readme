This is the dungeon game created by Darron Anderson
For the final assignement i decided to add in spells and spell parsing from files
spell have to types destruction shown as a 0 and restoration shown as a 1
additionally you must first learn a spell from a book before you can use it
to learn a spell press U and select the spell
you can then cast a spell with C
and display info about the spell with S
restoration spell books are yellow 
destruction are red
lastly added mana
mana is a players ability to cast spells if the player dosn't have as much mana as the cost of a spell they cant cast it
mana regenerates at a rate of per turn up to 100
If your having trouble finding spells open object.cpp and change the value in line 52 to a higher number then recompile
I intentionally set up a special limit ability of spell books to generate as there are alot of spell books and it can drown out other objects easily changing this value will make testing spells simpiler
